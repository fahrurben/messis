### Messis
Messis is a harvest time tracking app clone. I build this as alternative to Harvest that is not have 
free subscriptions.

I design the application as Software as Service (SAAS). So, this application can handle
multiple client in multi tenant.

The application can running using docker

Application consist of two services:
1. Backend 
2. Frontend

To running both service please check both folder README.MD file how to run the service
